# Hey, I'm Sergio 😄
Still making my way thorugh the hood. Here I post most of my learning process, so don´t be surprised if you find some console.logs lurking around...__
You may also find some open-source projects I've contributed and some of my own as well!
Feel free to reach out to me, no matter wether its a critique, feedback, advice, encouragement or just wanting to say hi 👋

## About Me:
👨🏻‍🎓 I'm a 3rd year B.S. Electronics Engineering student, as such, I've got a profound technical preparation, analitical thinking and abstraction capacity. I posess a strong academic inclination, which tends to orient my decision making, keeping me in constant learning and on the lookout for new aspirations. 

💻 I undertook my own computer business, I educated myself into web development technologies, with which I managed to participate in open-source projects and start-ups; and pulled-off the adventure of emigrating and developing myself as a teacher in multiple areas. 

💡 I count with experience working along diverse people and teams, mediating solutions and creating strategic planifications while valorating the organization and resource distribution.

🎯 I aim to expand professionally as a Frontend Developer to bring life into web applications, to reduce unnecessary frictions and turning them more enjoyable and intuitive. I want to generate exceptionally pleasing user experiences.
